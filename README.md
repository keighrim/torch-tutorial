# PyTorch Tutorial 

This is adaptation of [*WHAT IS TORCH.NN REALLY?*](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html), one of 
the beginner level tutorials from the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/). 

While the original tutorial was written in a ipython notebook, this adapted version is written in a plain `py` file. 
Plus, instead of notebook-style monkey-patching refactoring shown in the original version, here git commits are made and tagged
at each noticeable moment of refactoring to clearly show the evolution of the code from plain python implementation to torch implementation. 

Please start from [`vanilla` commit](../../tree/vanilla) and move forward along with commit history to follow the tutorial.
